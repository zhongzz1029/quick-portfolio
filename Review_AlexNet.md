## Review of paper ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Network

**Paper Summarization:** This Paper mainly proposed a deep convolutionl neural network, it was the deep convolutional network in 2012, whcih has five convolution layers and three fully connected layers. It achieved outstanding performace in 2012 ImageNet Competition with top-5 error and top-1 error of 26.2% and 15.3% respectively. What's more, it outperformed the architecture in the second position by more than 10 percent in accuracy.
