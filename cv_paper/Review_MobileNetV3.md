# Review of MobileNetV3 [Searching for MobileNetV3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02244.pdf) 

The paper explains how to build efficient CNN models on mobile devices with the help of complementary search techniques and novel architecture design. Two models are also introduced, MobileV3-Large and MobileV3-Small, which are used in high and low resource use cases. MobileNetV3 models achieve new SOTA results for image classification, objection dection and semantic segmentation.
