FCN:one of the fisrt proposed models for end-to-end semantic segmentation. SOTA cnns are converted to fully convolutional by making FC layers 1x1 convolutions. **Transposed** convolutions are used to upsample. skip connections are used. 

SegNet: encoder-decoder framework. encodrer and decoder are symmetrical to each other. 

UNet: encoder-decoder framework with skip connections. 

PSPNet: Pyramid scene Parsing Network. Kind of like SPPNet, pool feature into different sizes, and combine them together. 


UNet for medical domain, FCN & SegNet for small dataset.
