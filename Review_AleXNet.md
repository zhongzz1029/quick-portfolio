## This is my review of the paper, [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Network](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) 

**Paper summary:** This paper proposed a convolutional neural network, AlexNet, which was the deepest convolutioanl network back in 2012. AlexNet consists of eight layers, five convolution layer and three fully connected layers. It achieved outstanding performance with top-5 error rate and top-1 error rate of 15.3% and 26.2%, which helped them won the first place in 2012 ImageNet Competition. It outperformed the architecture by more than 10% in accuracy.
